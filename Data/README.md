Files/instructions on how to access all data used in SPEAR manuscript.

COVID-19:
All files are made accessible from *Su, Y. et al. Multi-Omics Resolves a Sharp Disease-State Shift between Mild and Moderate COVID-19. Cell 183, 1479-1495.e20 (2020)*
All this data can also be extracted directly from that paper, but we provide the computable matrices that we used in our analyses.

+ Su_COVID19_Plasma_Proteomics.csv

  + Raw proteomic expression data

+ Su_COVID19_Plasma_Metabolomic.csv

  + Raw metabolomic expression data

+ Su_COVID19_RF-Imputted-Proteomic.csv

  + RF imputed proteomic expression data

+ Su_COVID19_RF-Imputted-Metabolic.csv

  + RF imputed metabolomic expression data

+ Su_COVID19_Response.csv

  + COVID-19 response data for samples

+ Su_COVID19_clinical.xlsx

  + Clinical data for samples


TCGA-BC:
All files are made accessible from *Singh, A. et al. DIABLO: an integrative approach for identifying key molecular drivers from multi-omics assays. Bioinforma. Oxf. Engl. 35, 3055â€“3062 (2019)*

The data files (*Singh_TCGA_TCGA.normalised.mixDIABLO.RData* and *Singh_TCGA_trainTestDatasetsNormalized.RDATA*) are too large for GitHub (200 Mb). We are deciding the best way to host them. Until then, reach out to me (jeremy.gygi@yale.edu) for access to these two files.
